# Template
  
I'll consider copying/adding some useful template for deploying AWS cloud use scripts.  
  
Inside here has belows folder contains belows information.  
  
| Folder Name | Description |  
| --- | --- |  
| java | AWS Official CDK example written in java. |  
| python | AWS Official CDK example written in python. |  
| typescript | AWS Official CDK example written in typescript. |  
  
Might update some CloudFormat Template inside this folder in future, might listed as `.yaml` `.json` or `.py` files.
